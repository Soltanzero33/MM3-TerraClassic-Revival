# 🧠 MM 3.0 — Organic Revival Proposal for Terra Classic

A community-led, data-backed proposal to revive Terra Classic and restore USTC peg through hybrid reserve, phased liquidity, DAO governance, and protocol reactivation.

---

## 🔰 Overview

**Project:** MM 3.0 (Mathematical Model)  
**Focus:** USTC Repeg, LUNC Burn, DAO Activation  
**Protocols Targeted:** Anchor, Mirror, Nexus, Astroport  
**Date:** August 2025  
**Proposed by:** Terra Classic DAO / (SZ)

## 🛠️ Core Goals

- Restore USTC peg via hybrid BTC-LUNC-USD1 reserve model
- Enable ±5% peg deviation-based yield injection
- Fully revive Anchor, Mirror, Nexus protocols with DAO control
- Re-enable key DEXes like Astroport for liquidity
- Defend against Sybil attacks with LSTM AI detection
- Build secure, auditable architecture with VWMA oracles

---

## 📈 Peg Formula (Hybrid Reserve)
USTC_peg = [(BTC_reserve × BTC_price) + (LUNC_reserve × LUNC_price) + (USD1_reserve × 1)] / USTC_supply

## 🧭 Phased Peg Targets

| Phase | Month | Target Price |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| 1     | 1      | $0.02         |
| 2     | 3      | $0.04         |
| 3     | 6      | $0.08         |
| 4     | 9      | $0.16         |
| 5     | 12     | $0.32         |
| 6     | 18     | $0.64         |
| 7     | 24     | $1.00         |

## 🛡 Security Highlights

- VWMA Oracle (resistant to flash-loan)
- LSTM AI for Sybil detection (95%+ accuracy)
- Auto-Yield on deviation (±5%)
- DAO-based pause triggers
- Full audits by Halborn & Trail of Bits
